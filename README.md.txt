# Task Manager CLI

A small command-line Task Manager written in Python — my first project on the road to becoming an LLM Engineer.  
It supports adding, listing, completing, and deleting tasks, and stores tasks in a JSON file.

## Features
- Add tasks with optional due date
- List incomplete or all tasks
- Mark tasks as done
- Delete tasks
- JSON-based persistent storage

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/task-manager-cli.git
cd task-manager-cli
